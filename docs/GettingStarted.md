# Getting Started

## Installing

It is recommended to use Axis as a git submodule.

### Git submodule
use the git submodule command to add Axis as a submodule to your game:  
`git submodule add [GITHUB PATH] Submodules/Axis`  
Once you have it as a submodule, you can add it to your `default.project.json` to let rojo sync. You can look at the included `default.project.json` file to see what to add to your own project file. Make sure you also have all the dependencies installed (Everything in the `wally.toml` file).

### Wally
Axis is available on wally (not very stable atm) [here](https://wally.run/package/sebastian2852/axis).
